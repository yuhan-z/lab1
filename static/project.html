		<p>Interacting with media and games is a challenging user
experience on smartwatches due to their small screens. We
propose using lateral force feedback to enhance these
experiences. When virtual objects on the smartwatch
display visually collide or push the edge of the screen, we
add haptic feedback so that the user also feels the impact.
This addition creates the illusion of a virtual object that is
physically hitting or pushing the smartwatch, from within
the device itself.</p>
